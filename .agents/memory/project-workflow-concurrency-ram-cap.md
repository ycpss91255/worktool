On 2026-07-05 the 38GB dev machine hit 35/38GB used + swapping, appearing to
stall many parallel workflows. I WRONGLY blamed the workflows' kcov coverage
runs and stopped three of them. The real cause: FIVE runaway `tmux-powerline`
processes (`~/.config/tmux/plugins/tmux-powerline/powerline.sh`), each stuck ~49
min at ~6GB RSS = ~30GB. Killing those five PIDs dropped usage from 34GB to 4GB
instantly. The Docker workflows used real but MANAGEABLE RAM; they were not the
hog. (The tmux-powerline runaway is the maintainer's to fix separately.)

**Lessons:**
1. Before attributing high RAM to the workflows, READ the actual top processes'
   cmdline: `ps -eo pid,rss,etime,comm --sort=-rss | head` then
   `tr '\\0' ' ' < /proc/<PID>/cmdline`. A "bash" at 6GB is suspicious -- check
   what it is. Do not assume it is kcov/Docker.
2. The earlier "coverage gate = ~29GB, cap concurrency at 2" conclusion was WRONG
   on the REASON (that 29GB was powerline, not kcov). RAM is NOT the binding
   limit. But there IS a real CONCURRENCY cap and it is CPU: each workflow's gate
   (`ci.sh --ci-unit`) parallelizes internally to nproc (sharded bats + the
   parallel `shellcheck -P nproc` from PR #297), so N concurrent workflows spawn
   ~N*nproc busy processes. Running 4 at once drove load average to ~65 on an
   8-core box -- gates that take ~5min crawled to 25min+ (CPU-oversubscribed, NOT
   hung: confirmed via `docker stats` showing 120-159% CPU on the "stuck" ci-run
   containers). So cap concurrent workflows at ~2 for CPU reasons. Distinguish
   hung (low CPU + long) from slow (high CPU + long = oversubscription) with
   `docker stats --no-stream` before intervening.
3. Failed/stopped workflows DO orphan Docker containers (they do not auto-clean);
   remove them targeted by name prefix `docker ps -aq --filter name=wf_<runid> |
   xargs -r docker rm -f` (never prune / global ops).
4. The compose-based `just -f justfile.ci` gate recipes leak containers across
   stages (a workflow accumulates 7-10). Worth a teardown fix, but it is not the
   RAM emergency it looked like.
5. They ALSO leak a compose NETWORK per worktree (named `<worktree>_default`, i.e.
   `wf_*_default` / `agent-*_default`). These accumulate and eventually SUBNET THE
   DOCKER ADDRESS POOL DRY (seen 2026-07-10: ~34 orphaned bridge networks blocked
   every new compose-network create, so `just test-unit`/`lint` failed to start;
   agents worked around it via a bare `docker run` on the default bridge). Clean
   targeted (NOT `docker network prune`): `docker network ls --format '{{.Name}}'
   | grep -E '^(wf_|agent-).*_default$' | xargs -r docker network rm` when no
   Docker compose workflow is running. This is the same class of leak as the
   worktree accumulation - sweep both between big batches.

- NEVER run two agents/gates on the SAME worktree concurrently: they share the
  Docker `/source` bind mount, so two `ci.sh` runs racing while git mutates the
  tree produce SPURIOUS gate failures (seen 2026-07-05: a one-file deletion got
  3 overlapping agents on one worktree -> 8 bogus test-unit failures; GitHub's
  isolated CI was green). For a tiny cleanup, use ONE workflow with a proper
  integrate stage, not several ad-hoc agents on a shared worktree.
