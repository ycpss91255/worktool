# WHAT THIS PROVES
#   ADR 0002 (the box owns its HOME, issue #197) records a decision whose
#   interfaces are NOT built yet: `just box assemble --home`, the refusal on
#   a HOME conflict, the user-config symlinks and TMUX_TMPDIR. Each of
#   decision items 2-4 must say so and name the issue that will build it
#   (#198 / #199 / #179), so nobody reads them as current behaviour
#   (codex round 1 on PR #222). The ADR must also not postpone the
#   architecture diagram: the repo rule is that a decision that changes a
#   diagram updates it in the same PR.
#
# Written test-first: RED against the round-0 ADR (present-tense items,
# diagram listed among the deferred rewrites), GREEN after the fix.
